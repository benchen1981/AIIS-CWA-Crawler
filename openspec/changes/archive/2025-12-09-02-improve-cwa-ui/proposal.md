# Proposal: Improve CWA App UI

## Context
The user requested an immediate update to the Web UI to match the official CWA Temperature Observation page (https://www.cwa.gov.tw/V8/C/W/OBS_Temp.html). The current UI is a basic Streamlit table.

## Requirements
-   **Visual Consistency**: Mimic CWA colors (blue/white theme), font styles, and header layout.
-   **Table Layout**: Ensure column headers match CWA conventions (City, Site, Temp, Time).
-   **Responsiveness**: Maintain readability.

## Out of Scope
-   Exact pixel-perfect replication (limited by Streamlit's constraints compared to raw HTML/CSS).
